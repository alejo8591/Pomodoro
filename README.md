## Steps to make the translation
* Be translated into Spanish
* The idea is to be the official guide of the methodology The Pomodoro Technique®
* Why through git and github?: because you must have a version control since several people 
  can be manipulated and the idea is that we follow the same line to get a porducto 
  mature and ready to ship officially.
