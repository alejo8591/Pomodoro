The Pomodoro Technique
======================

Translation of the official guide to Spanish of the Pomodoro Technique

## Anyone concerned
* Official website of the methodology [Pomodoro Technique®](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) 
* The Pomodoro Technique® [Official book for download](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf)

## Steps to make the translation
* Be translated into Spanish
* The idea is to be the official guide of the methodology The Pomodoro Technique®
* because you must have a version control since several people can be manipulated and the idea is that we follow the same 
  line to get a porducto mature and ready to ship officially
